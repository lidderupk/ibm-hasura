## Introduction to GraphQL, a query language for APIs - 02/07/18
Join IBM Developer SF for two talks regarding Apache Openwhisk and Graph QL.

Main Talk
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Learn how to use GraphQL to streamline API development and API integration process. In this session, we will provide an introduction to GraphQL and its advantages and trade offs. This talk is ideal for developers who are either new to GraphQL or are familiar with other APIs and are looking to see what GraphQL could bring to the table. Come learn about what GraphQL is, its use cases, and how it works under the hood.

Lightning Talk
This 15 minute lightning talk will provide an introduction to Apache Openwhisk - an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications.

You will learn about different use cases of Serverless, and get a head start with a live code example. We will talk about functions and event driven paradigm on serverless.
